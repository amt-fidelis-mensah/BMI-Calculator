<h2 class="BMI-result">
  What your BMI result means
</h2>
  <p class="result-paragragh">A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
    healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
    such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
    fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
    strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
    five days a week.</p>
